This is a version of LESS, a file viewer, that has been modified heavily.
It is based on the original program, located at http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/

However, it is modified to work better on POSIX systems, and uses APIs that older
systems and Microsoft platforms might lack.

To build it, type "make STD=<x>" where x is one of ILLUMOS, MACOS, SUSv2, SUSv3, etc.
See the Makefile for more details.  There is a "STD=default" option you can try if your
platform isn't listed.

See the README.less and README.illumos for more information.

Enjoy!
